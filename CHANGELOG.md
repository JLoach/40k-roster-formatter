## Version 1.01
- Partially resolved bug with pasting text to reddit comments (issue #40). Adapted output to Reddit markdown editor.
- Updated UI: simplified a bit, then added more complexity :D
- Fixed copy-pasting of results to reddit (Working in Markdown editor only, sorry, but fancyeditor is a mess)
- Added option to write number of models in the unit
- Added option to count and show secondaries (beta-version, please notify me of any bugs)
- Added different output formats (including WTC)
- Added option to remove unit costs (well, someone asked)
